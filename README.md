Unit 5 Trivia Game

This is my Trivia Game from week 5 of our coding bootcamp where our focus was on using Javascript with JQuery to create a dynamic quiz-style webpage.

We also made use of javascript timeouts and intervals to create countdowns.

We were to use logic to determine number of completed questions, correct answers, and incorrect answers to display on page.

When you select the "Start" button, the timer begins! Good luck!
